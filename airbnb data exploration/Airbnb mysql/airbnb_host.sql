Chatting with guests upon check in lets me not only tell them what a great city Boston is and how much it has to offer but to also listen to stories of where they live or have been to. That\'s what makes Airbnb such a great community builder in my mind - connecting people from all parts and walks of life. \nJust like all of the travelers that I\'ve hosted, I am a traveler myself - having been to a number of countries in Central Asia, Europe, and lived for a time in Micronesia. Each time I travel, I make sure to find a local connection to tell me about places off the beaten path that a tourist guide might miss, and if all else fails - I just enjoy seeing where my feet (or a local bus/train/subway) take me. So if you\'re looking for the best Ethiopian food in Boston or a little known museum (a whole room of the most realistic glass flowers hand blown in the 19th century), I can definitely point you in the right direction. \nSpeaking of directions, I bike a LOT around town and would be happy to provide a bike when you stay at either of my places. Boston may have a great (oldest in North America) subway system, but sometimes it\'s just nice to get on a bike and see where the next street takes you!\nWhat keeps me not only travelling on Airbnb but also hosting are the notes that I frequently get, letting me know what a great time someone had or how much they enjoyed visiting a part of city I mentioned to them.

I couldn\'t sleep, I woke, wrote, went back to bed, got up again, and wrote some more. \n\n I\'m writing from Boston\'s Historic South End, it\'s 4:45am birds are beginning to sing. Sirens can be heard in the distance now. I live eight brief minutes on foot from the Marathon\'s Finish Line. I\'m still in shock. Very sad and very angry that this could happen. Especially in this city, one of the most peaceful and progressive in the country.... happen in front of our library, the first public library in the country during a \"people\'s sporting event\". We are a city with many \"sport\'s palaces\" but this event is for the every citizen. It\'s not dominated by high salaries and expensive admission. It\'s a free event here in a city that so often makes history and writes laws that have extended social justice, rights, and freedoms to so many of us. We were the first Common Wealth and our constitution was the model for The United States Constitution which has extended rights and freedoms to so many. A constitution whose rights and freedoms are too easily limited by cynical people who sow fear and hate.\nNow it\'s 7:24 am.. more sirens, the trash truck is trashing out back, the helicopters are again in the air, the streets are empty. Last night walking home from Foodies with salad-to-go, the few who were out walked in silence, the restaurants were closed. I\'m in tears. I‚Äôm looking at my (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) cover photo singing with (URL HIDDEN) last March.\n\nOur December 14 concert fades in. It was just after the senseless deaths of NewTown CT school children. Reuben, our director, introduced us singing Leonard Cohen\'s Hallelujah and I don\'t remember his exact words but they went something like... \"Today people asked me how we could be singing at a time like this, and I said HOW COULD WE NOT BE SINGING, singing Hallelujah. Cohen\'s, Hallelujah, a song of praise. A song that has more than 100 verses.\" He went on. \"A song that needs so many verses because Cohen\'s asking... ASKING how do I sing praise... how do I sing Hallelujah.\" \n\nReuben\'s words stopped and our singing began, and when our singing stopped Jordon Hall rose in a standing ovation. It\'s was a moment I\'ll never forget, a Dec 14 moment, a day I\'ll never forget. I don\'t remember Reuben\'s exact words, and yet, I can rebuild what he said as the thought and the moment will never leave me. \n\nAnd now one day and four months later, in the middle of the month, on a day we celebrate our Patriot\'s, a holiday, a holy day, here in Massachusetts, in my city, my hometown, on the 17th century streets, streets I\'ve walked countless times, there\'s more sudden senseless death. \n\nThis time let\'s not use this sacred time as an excuse to start wars-for-profit. Here in Massachusetts we have the will to change our sadness, our loss, out anger into a social movement. Let us begin, and let us begin by singing, singing Hallelujahs.\n\nMY CAREER & INTERESTS\nI\'m a retired professor of Management and Accounting, Massasoit Community College.

Writing from my home in the JP neighborhood of Boston. Today I got to stay at home. I work freelance in film production so I get a lot of time off between projects. My job is best described as \"art department\" although, set builder, propmaker, prop, effects, set dresser... are other terms for the work I do. Anyway, art dept. is what I write on my time cards. Today I did none of that. I fixed up a couple of 80\'s Japanese road bikes and one 60\'s Raleigh 3 speed in the sun in front of our house. Me and my daughter are getting ready to go down to NYC where we will set up our wares for sale on the street in Brooklyn (15 bikes and a table of her arts and crafts). Can\'t wait. It\'s super fun to be on the street talking to the people, hearing the music from the passing traffic, smiling at the ladies, eating crazy street food, and putting people on nice bikes. This is the best kind of day for me. It\'s got everything, travel, all kinds of people, my daughter w/ me, friends dropping by, a couple bucks in my pocket, truck tacos, street fashion... Magdalena , my 15 year old, creative, self possessed, funny, daughter makes me feel proud and secure when she hawks her crafts. I look at her talk everyone, so confident, open hearted but savvy, and I feel like she\'s gonna be okay where ever she goes. The art of survival. I\'m an artist. Sculptor. Went to art school. Can make anything. But what I love most to make is my way thru life. It\'s the best art. But unlike art it is totally accessible because everyone does it. blaa blaa... back to today... I also did some drawings for a chicken coop that I\'m going to build next week with my buddy Jenny. Some local chicken activists approached us with the project. These chicken people want to repeal laws that prevent keeping chickens in the city of Boston. They would like to display some chickens at our local earth/may day festival in a clean,(hopefully) well designed, urban chicken coop. What else? I fixed the passenger side headlight of my truck, paid some bills, ate some mochi, did the dark laundry, made some calls to spread the word about a friend who is on his last legs in a fight w/cancer, pulled some bamboo shoots that were creeping ever further out of their corner of the yard. Magdalena came home tonight beaming. There was an after school dance, ice cream with friends afterwards and thrift shopping after that. She sat on the couch and gave me a play by play of her day. I love that\nWell, there it is. I think that worked out pretty good. It\'s a good thing I didn\'t work today or you\'d of heard all about it...\nIE: today I built a city diorama in 1\":1\' scale. Went pretty smooth but the tiny bus stop benches looked gigantic next to the wee news paper boxes. Weird because both were built with out straying from the 1\":1\' format.

Thank you for checking out my profile! \nI am a relatively new member at airbnb and could not be more excited about this new journey in my life - having spent the last 20 years in the fascinating world of finance - I could not be more open to a change in scenery. Although I love finance - meeting and hosting people from all over the world has an extraordinary appeal to me. I raised six children - yours, mine and ours. They range from ages 19 through 24 - a true Brady Bunch - 3 girls and 3 boys. All of them are doing wonderful things and have moved to school, serving in the military or have started their own family. Like a significant amount of \"middle aged,\" folks I am not only an empty nester - but have recently become single and am rediscovering myself and life. What a fascinating journey that is. One of the big steps that I took was to move into the city - my motivation for the move was that I thought it would be a lot more fun than living in the suburbs. I was correct. There is never a dull moment in the city! The people watching is captivating - the culture is bright, enthusiastic and alive with a feeling of constant rebirth - students moving in, moving out, medical professionals coming in and then moving on, business professionals attending conventions and tourists visiting our fine city and then returning home - It is truly a magical place and there is no where that I would rather be - well...ok - maybe I would like to be in Namibia, South Africa.'),(19044311,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19044311','Julie',''),(19055159,10,1,'MA','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19055159','Mark',''),(19056916,2,1,'MA','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19056916','Mattaya',''),(19066350,51,5,'NY','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19066350','Eric','Finance professional with a thirst for traveling, and an appreciation for learning and exploration.'),(19174854,13,1,'MA','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19174854','James',''),(19180140,22,1,'MA','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19180140','Paul',''),(19223882,1,1,'MA','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19223882','Rosa','I am a citizen of the world, born in Santo Domingo, D R.\nI like to travel and to write'),(19241302,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19241302','Deborah',''),(19246369,34,1,'MA','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19246369','Joe',''),(19250407,22,1,'MA','US','https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/19250407','Alex (And Bob)','Alex lives in the condo in the 2nd bedroom and manages the property.
